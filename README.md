# Tennis Match Outcome Predictor ðŸŽ¾

This project predicts the outcome of professional tennis matches using historical ATP match data.  
It demonstrates an **end-to-end data science and machine learning workflow** â€” from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), to feature engineering, model building, and deployment of a lightweight predictive model.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Player performance, surface differences, and match outcome patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Player win rates, surface performance, head-to-head stats, and rank differences.
- **Modeling:**
  - **Full model (~99% accuracy):** Demonstrates pipelines and feature engineering, but not predictive since it uses in-match stats.
  - **Lightweight model:** Uses pre-match features for realistic predictions.
- **Prediction Function:** Run matchups between any two players on any surface.

## Usage
Option 1: Run prediction script
python scripts/predict.py

Option 2: Import function in Python
from scripts.predict import predict_match

prob = predict_match("Nadal", "Federer", "Clay")
print(f"Probability Nadal beats Federer on Clay: {prob:.2f}")

Example prediction
Input:  Player = "Nadal", Opponent = "Federer", Surface = "Clay"
Output: Probability Nadal wins â‰ˆ 0.72

Notes:
The full model demonstrates end-to-end ML pipelines but isnâ€™t predictive.
The lightweight model is intended for real-world pre-match predictions.
EDA highlighted important trends like surface effects, dominance of top players, and ranking differences.
